# Architecture Overview

GSD is a TypeScript application built on the [Pi SDK](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It embeds the Pi coding agent and extends it with the GSD workflow engine, auto mode state machine, and project management primitives.

## System Structure

```
gsd (CLI binary)
  └─ loader.ts          Sets PI_PACKAGE_DIR, GSD env vars, dynamic-imports cli.ts
      └─ cli.ts         Wires SDK managers, loads extensions, starts InteractiveMode
          ├─ onboarding.ts   First-run setup wizard (LLM provider + tool keys)
          ├─ wizard.ts       Env hydration from stored auth.json credentials
          ├─ app-paths.ts    ~/.gsd/agent/, ~/.gsd/sessions/, auth.json
          ├─ resource-loader.ts  Syncs bundled extensions + agents to ~/.gsd/agent/
          └─ src/resources/
              ├─ extensions/gsd/    Core GSD extension
              ├─ extensions/...     12 supporting extensions
              ├─ agents/            scout, researcher, worker
              ├─ AGENTS.md          Agent routing instructions
              └─ GSD-WORKFLOW.md    Manual bootstrap protocol
```

## Key Design Decisions

### State Lives on Disk

`.gsd/` is the sole source of truth. Auto mode reads it, writes it, and advances based on what it finds. No in-memory state survives across sessions. This enables crash recovery, multi-terminal steering, and session resumption.

### Two-File Loader Pattern

`loader.ts` sets all environment variables with zero SDK imports, then dynamically imports `cli.ts` which does static SDK imports. This ensures `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` is set before any SDK code evaluates.

### `pkg/` Shim Directory

`PI_PACKAGE_DIR` points to `pkg/` (not project root) to avoid Pi's theme resolution colliding with GSD's `src/` directory. Contains only `piConfig` and theme assets.

### Always-Overwrite Sync

Bundled extensions and agents are synced to `~/.gsd/agent/` on every launch, not just first run. This means `npm update -g` takes effect immediately.

### Fresh Session Per Unit

Every dispatch creates a new agent session. The LLM starts with a clean context window containing only the pre-inlined artifacts it needs. This prevents quality degradation from context accumulation.

## Bundled Extensions

| Extension | What It Provides |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **GSD** | Core workflow engine — auto mode, state machine, commands, dashboard |
| **Browser Tools** | Playwright-based browser with form intelligence and semantic actions |
| **Search the Web** | Brave Search, Tavily, or Jina page extraction |
| **Google Search** | Gemini-powered web search with AI-synthesized answers |
| **Context7** | Up-to-date library/framework documentation |
| **Background Shell** | Long-running process management with readiness detection |
| **Subagent** | Delegated tasks with isolated context windows |
| **Mac Tools** | macOS native app automation via Accessibility APIs |
| **MCPorter** | Lazy on-demand MCP server integration |
| **Voice** | Real-time speech-to-text (macOS, Linux) |
| **Slash Commands** | Custom command creation |
| **LSP** | Language Server Protocol — diagnostics, definitions, references, hover, rename |
| **Ask User Questions** | Structured user input with single/multi-select |
| **Secure Env Collect** | Masked secret collection |

## Bundled Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Scout** | Fast codebase recon — compressed context for handoff |
| **Researcher** | Web research — finds and synthesizes current information |
| **Worker** | General-purpose execution in an isolated context window |

## Native Engine

Performance-critical operations use a Rust N-API engine:

- **grep** — ripgrep-backed content search
- **glob** — gitignore-aware file discovery
- **ps** — cross-platform process tree management
- **highlight** — syntect-based syntax highlighting
- **ast** — structural code search via ast-grep
- **diff** — fuzzy text matching and unified diff generation
- **text** — ANSI-aware text measurement and wrapping
- **html** — HTML-to-Markdown conversion
- **image** — decode, encode, resize images
- **fd** — fuzzy file path discovery
- **clipboard** — native clipboard access
- **git** — libgit2-backed git read operations (v2.16+)
- **parser** — GSD file parsing and frontmatter extraction

## Dispatch Pipeline

The auto mode dispatch pipeline:

```
1. Read disk state (STATE.md, roadmap, plans)
2. Determine next unit type and ID
3. Classify complexity → select model tier
4. Apply budget pressure adjustments
5. Check routing history for adaptive adjustments
6. Resolve effective model (with fallbacks)
7. Build dispatch prompt (applying inline level compression)
8. Create fresh agent session
9. Inject prompt and let LLM execute
10. On completion: snapshot metrics, verify artifacts, persist state
11. Loop to step 1
```

Phase skipping (from token profile) gates steps 2-3: if a phase is skipped, the corresponding unit type is never dispatched.
