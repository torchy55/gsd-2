# Auto Mode

Auto mode is GSD's autonomous execution engine. Run `/gsd auto`, walk away, come back to built software with clean git history.

## How It Works

Auto mode is a **state machine driven by files on disk**. It reads `.gsd/STATE.md`, determines the next unit of work, creates a fresh agent session, injects a focused prompt with all relevant context pre-inlined, and lets the LLM execute. When the LLM finishes, auto mode reads disk state again and dispatches the next unit.

### The Loop

Each slice flows through phases automatically:

```
Research → Plan → Execute (per task) → Complete → Reassess Roadmap → Next Slice
```

- **Research** — scouts the codebase and relevant docs
- **Plan** — decomposes the slice into tasks with must-haves
- **Execute** — runs each task in a fresh context window
- **Complete** — writes summary, UAT script, marks roadmap, commits
- **Reassess** — checks if the roadmap still makes sense

## Key Properties

### Fresh Session Per Unit

Every task, research phase, and planning step gets a clean context window. No accumulated garbage. No degraded quality from context bloat. The dispatch prompt includes everything needed — task plans, prior summaries, dependency context, decisions register — so the LLM starts oriented instead of spending tool calls reading files.

### Context Pre-Loading

The dispatch prompt is carefully constructed with:

| Inlined Artifact | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| Task plan | What to build |
| Slice plan | Where this task fits |
| Prior task summaries | What's already done |
| Dependency summaries | Cross-slice context |
| Roadmap excerpt | Overall direction |
| Decisions register | Architectural context |

The amount of context inlined is controlled by your [token profile](./token-optimization.md). Budget mode inlines minimal context; quality mode inlines everything.

### Git Worktree Isolation

Each milestone runs in its own git worktree with a `milestone/<MID>` branch. All slice work commits sequentially — no branch switching, no merge conflicts mid-milestone. When the milestone completes, it's squash-merged to main as one clean commit.

See [Git Strategy](./git-strategy.md) for details.

### Crash Recovery

A lock file tracks the current unit. If the session dies, the next `/gsd auto` reads the surviving session file, synthesizes a recovery briefing from every tool call that made it to disk, and resumes with full context.

### Stuck Detection

If the same unit dispatches twice (the LLM didn't produce the expected artifact), GSD retries once with a deep diagnostic prompt. If it fails again, auto mode stops with the exact file it expected, so you can intervene.

### Timeout Supervision

Three timeout tiers prevent runaway sessions:

| Timeout | Default | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Soft | 20 min | Warns the LLM to wrap up |
| Idle | 10 min | Detects stalls, intervenes |
| Hard | 30 min | Pauses auto mode |

Recovery steering nudges the LLM to finish durable output before timing out. Configure in preferences:

```yaml
auto_supervisor:
  soft_timeout_minutes: 20
  idle_timeout_minutes: 10
  hard_timeout_minutes: 30
```

### Cost Tracking

Every unit's token usage and cost is captured, broken down by phase, slice, and model. The dashboard shows running totals and projections. Budget ceilings can pause auto mode before overspending.

See [Cost Management](./cost-management.md).

### Adaptive Replanning

After each slice completes, the roadmap is reassessed. If the work revealed new information that changes the plan, slices are reordered, added, or removed before continuing. This can be skipped with the `balanced` or `budget` token profiles.

## Controlling Auto Mode

### Start

```
/gsd auto
```

### Pause

Press **Escape**. The conversation is preserved. You can interact with the agent, inspect state, or resume.

### Resume

```
/gsd auto
```

Auto mode reads disk state and picks up where it left off.

### Stop

```
/gsd stop
```

Stops auto mode gracefully. Can be run from a different terminal.

### Steer

```
/gsd steer
```

Hard-steer plan documents during execution without stopping the pipeline. Changes are picked up at the next phase boundary.

## Dashboard

`Ctrl+Alt+G` or `/gsd status` shows real-time progress:

- Current milestone, slice, and task
- Auto mode elapsed time and phase
- Per-unit cost and token breakdown
- Cost projections
- Completed and in-progress units

## Phase Skipping

Token profiles can skip certain phases to reduce cost:

| Phase | `budget` | `balanced` | `quality` |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Milestone Research | Skipped | Runs | Runs |
| Slice Research | Skipped | Skipped | Runs |
| Reassess Roadmap | Skipped | Runs | Runs |

See [Token Optimization](./token-optimization.md) for details.
