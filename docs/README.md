# GSD Documentation

Welcome to the GSD documentation. This covers everything from getting started to advanced configuration, auto-mode internals, and extending GSD with the Pi SDK.

## User Documentation

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) | Installation, first run, and basic usage |

| [Commands Reference](./commands.md) | All commands, keyboard shortcuts, and CLI flags |
| [Configuration](./configuration.md) | Preferences, model selection, git settings, and token profiles |
| [Token Optimization](./token-optimization.md) | Token profiles, context compression, complexity routing, and adaptive learning (v2.17) |
| [Cost Management](./cost-management.md) | Budget ceilings, cost tracking, projections, and enforcement modes |
| [Git Strategy](./git-strategy.md) | Worktree isolation, branching model, and merge behavior |
| [Working in Teams](./working-in-teams.md) | Unique milestone IDs, `.gitignore` setup, and shared planning artifacts |
| [Skills](./skills.md) | Bundled skills, skill discovery, and custom skill authoring |
| [Migration from v1](./migration.md) | Migrating `.planning` directories from the original GSD |
| [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) | Common issues, `/gsd doctor`, and recovery procedures |

## Architecture & Internals

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) | System design, extension model, state-on-disk, and dispatch pipeline |
| [Native Engine](../native/README.md) | Rust N-API modules for performance-critical operations |
| [ADR-001: Branchless Worktree Architecture](./ADR-001-branchless-worktree-architecture.md) | Decision record for the v2.14 git architecture |

## Pi SDK Documentation

These guides cover the underlying Pi SDK that GSD is built on. Useful if you want to extend GSD or build your own agent application.

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [What is Pi](./what-is-pi/README.md) | Core concepts — modes, agent loop, sessions, tools, providers |
| [Extending Pi](./extending-pi/README.md) | Building extensions — tools, commands, UI, events, state |
| [Context & Hooks](./context-and-hooks/README.md) | Context pipeline, hook reference, inter-extension communication |
| [Pi UI / TUI](./pi-ui-tui/README.md) | Terminal UI components, theming, keyboard input, rendering |

## Research

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Building Coding Agents](./building-coding-agents/README.md) | Research notes on agent design — decomposition, context engineering, cost/quality tradeoffs |
