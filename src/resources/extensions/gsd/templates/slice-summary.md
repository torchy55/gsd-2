# {{sliceId}}: {{sliceTitle}}

<!-- One-liner must say what actually shipped, not just that work completed.
     Good: "Structured job status endpoint with persisted failure diagnostics"
     Bad: "Status feature implemented" -->

**{{oneLiner}}**

## What Happened

{{narrative — compress task summaries into a coherent story}}

## Verification

{{whatWasVerifiedAcrossAllTasks — tests, builds, manual checks}}

<!-- If the project has no REQUIREMENTS.md, omit all four requirement sections below entirely — do not fill them with "none". These sections only apply when requirements are being actively tracked. -->
## Requirements Advanced

- {{requirementId}} — {{howThisSliceAdvancedIt}}

## Requirements Validated

- {{requirementId}} — {{whatProofNowMakesItValidated}}

## New Requirements Surfaced

- {{newRequirementOr_none}}

## Requirements Invalidated or Re-scoped

- {{requirementIdOr_none}} — {{what changed}}

## Deviations

<!-- Deviations are unplanned changes to the written plan, not ordinary debugging inside the plan's intended scope. -->

{{deviationsFromPlan_OR_none}}

## Known Limitations

<!-- Known limitations are real gaps, rough edges, or deferred constraints that still exist after this slice shipped. -->

{{whatDoesntWorkYet_OR_whatWasDeferredToLaterSlices}}

## Follow-ups

<!-- Follow-ups are concrete next actions discovered during execution, not a restatement of known limitations. -->

{{workDeferredOrDiscoveredDuringExecution_OR_none}}

## Files Created/Modified

- `{{filePath}}` — {{description}}
- `{{filePath}}` — {{description}}

## Forward Intelligence

<!-- Write what you wish you'd known at the start of this slice.
     This section is read by the next slice's planning and research steps.
     Be specific and concrete — this is the most valuable context you can transfer. -->
