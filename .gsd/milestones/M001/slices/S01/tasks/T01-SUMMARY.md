  - Applied the required pre-flight diagnostic verification addition to the slice plan before implementation work.
  - Stopped execution at the first concrete failing verification signal after the partial DB rewrite instead of attempting speculative recovery under low context.
  - Captured the exact root failure for resume: direct test execution now fails because `src/resources/extensions/gsd/gsd-db.ts` imports `./errors.js`, which is not resolvable in the current TypeScript test runtime.

# T01: Partially advanced schema v8 groundwork and documented the broken intermediate state for T01 resume

**Partially advanced schema v8 groundwork and documented the broken intermediate state for T01 resume**

## What Happened

I followed the execution contract in order until the context budget warning forced wrap-up. First I loaded the required skills, read the slice plan, task plan, and the target implementation files, and verified the current local reality: the codebase was still on schema v7, roadmap rendering only patched checkboxes, and importer migration only backfilled basic hierarchy state. I then fixed the mandatory pre-flight observability gap in the slice plan by adding a targeted verification entry for the inspectable failure-state path in `markdown-renderer.test.ts`. After that I traced the actual roadmap parser contract in `files.ts`, read the roadmap template and migration writer to avoid inventing a new markdown shape, and started the schema work in `src/resources/extensions/gsd/gsd-db.ts`. That partial rewrite introduced schema v8 structures and planning-oriented fields/helpers, but because the context budget warning arrived mid-unit I did not have enough budget left to safely finish the downstream renderer/importer/test changes or to recover from a runtime compatibility issue discovered during verification. I stopped immediately once the smallest concrete verification run showed the local failure mode, rather than making more unverified edits.

## Verification

I ran the smallest targeted verification commands for this task after the partial `gsd-db.ts` rewrite. Both targeted test commands failed immediately before exercising T01 behavior because Node could not resolve `src/resources/extensions/gsd/errors.js` from the rewritten `gsd-db.ts`. That gives a precise resume point: fix the rewritten DB module’s runtime-compatible imports/specifiers first, then continue implementing the renderer/importer/test updates and rerun the slice checks. The slice-plan pre-flight observability fix was applied successfully.

## Verification Evidence

| # | Command | Exit Code | Verdict | Duration |
|---|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | `node --test src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/migrate-hierarchy.test.ts` | 1 | ❌ fail | 102ms |
| 2 | `node --test src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/markdown-renderer.test.ts` | 1 | ❌ fail | 111ms |


## Deviations

Stopped early due to context budget warning before completing the planned renderer/importer/test updates. I fixed the pre-flight observability gap in `.gsd/milestones/M001/slices/S01/S01-PLAN.md` and partially rewrote `src/resources/extensions/gsd/gsd-db.ts` toward schema v8/planning helpers, but I did not finish `src/resources/extensions/gsd/markdown-renderer.ts`, `src/resources/extensions/gsd/md-importer.ts`, or the target tests. The attempted `markdown-renderer.ts` full rewrite was interrupted and did not land.

## Known Issues

`src/resources/extensions/gsd/gsd-db.ts` is currently in a broken intermediate state. Running the targeted tests fails immediately with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `src/resources/extensions/gsd/errors.js` imported from `gsd-db.ts`. `src/resources/extensions/gsd/markdown-renderer.ts`, `src/resources/extensions/gsd/md-importer.ts`, `src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/markdown-renderer.test.ts`, and `src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/migrate-hierarchy.test.ts` still need the actual T01 implementation work. Resume should start by restoring/fixing `gsd-db.ts` imports/runtime compatibility, then continue the v8 schema + roadmap renderer work.
